The reason for this specific number of small integer objects (44) is due to CPython's optimization strategy. In CPython, small integer objects in the range from -5 to 256 are preallocated and cached for performance reasons. These integers are stored in a pool, and whenever you create an integer within this range, Python just returns a reference to the existing object rather than creating a new one.
